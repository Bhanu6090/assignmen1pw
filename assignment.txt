Q1. Create one variable containing following type of data:
(i) string
(ii) list
(iii) float
(iv) tuple

# string 
   str = "i love pw skill"
# list 
    lst = [1,3,4,2.3,True,"python"]
# float 
    flt = 2.4 
#   tuple
    tpl = (1,2,3,"bhanu",1.2)          

Q2. Given are some following variables containing data:
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
(iv) var4 = 1.

answer 
1) var1 is not a variable it give syntax error
2) var2 is a string type variable
3) var3 is not a variable it also give syntax error because '' is wrong in ML
4) var4 is a float data type variable

Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
(ii) %
(iii) //
(iv) **

answer 
1). / is used for division of two number 
2). % is modulus operator which is used to find reminder.
3). // is Floor division operator which is used to find integer value after the division of two number 
4). ** Exponentiation is used for power operation in maths

Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the
element and its data type.
solution 
lst = [1,2,3,4,4.5,True,1+4j,"smile",4,5,6]
# where n is the length of list 
print("the list is :",lst)
for i in lst:
   print(i)

Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many
times it can be divisible.
a = int(input("enter the first variable: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second variable: "))
count = 0
while a%b == 0 :
    a/=b
    count += 1
if count >0:
   print("{a } is divisibleb y  {b} , {count} times")    
else :
   print("{a } is not divisible by {b}")

Q6. Create a list containing 25 int type data. Using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is
divisible by 3 or not.
lst = list(map(int, input("Enter the element of list:").strip().split()))[:n]   
for i in lst:
if i%3 == 0   
   print("{i} is divisible by 3")
else :
   print("{i} is not divisible by 3")
