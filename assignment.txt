Q1. Create one variable containing following type of data:
(i) string
(ii) list
(iii) float
(iv) tuple

# string 
   str = "i love pw skill"
# list 
    lst = [1,3,4,2.3,True,"python"]
# float 
    flt = 2.4 
#   tuple
    tpl = (1,2,3,"bhanu",1.2)          

Q2. Given are some following variables containing data:
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
(iv) var4 = 1.

answer 
1) var1 is not a variable it give syntax error
2) var2 is a string type variable
3) var3 is not a variable it also give syntax error because '' is wrong in ML
4) var4 is a float data type variable

Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
(ii) %
(iii) //
(iv) **

answer 
1). / is used for division of two number 
2). % is modulus operator which is used to find reminder.
3). // is Floor division operator which is used to find integer value after the division of two number 
4). ** Exponentiation is used for power operation in maths

Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the
element and its data type.
solution 
lst = list(map(int, input("Enter the integer \ element :").strip().split()))[:n]
# where n is the length of list 
print("the list is :",lst)
for i in lst:
   print(i)
